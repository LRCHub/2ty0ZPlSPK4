Wow...
I wish I could see you beyond what I see
And feel the way you touch me
Only if I still exist in the world
The world you live in
Wow...
Tell me why why so why can I not forgive myself
Inside my head I keep hearing echo
Tell me why why so why can I not forget my past
Inside my head I keep hearing echo
Tell me why why so why can I not forgive...
Just tell me why why so why
can I not forget my past
Inside my head I keep hearing echo
Somebody tell me why why so why
can I not forgive...
Inside my head I keep hearing echo
Tell me why why so why can I not forget my past
Inside my head I keep hearing echo
